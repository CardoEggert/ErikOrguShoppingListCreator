# ErikOrguShoppingListCreator

The point of this program is to let people who share the same account on Erikorgu get their own shopping list separately. <br />

Why I use this program? <br />
Because I share the account with some people, then I need to create the menus separately. <br />
When I have the menus done, then I usually would write out the things I need from the store. (Which takes a lot of time)<br />
This program makes it easier by writing all the components (which have quantities) to a text file.<br />
I take out the proudcts that I already have and print out the shopping list with the menus.<br />
<br />
The point of this program is to save time by making the shopping list creation process quicker.<br />
