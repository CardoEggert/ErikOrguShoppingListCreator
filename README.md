# ErikOrguShoppingListCreator

The point of this software is to let people who share the same account on Erikorgu get their own shopping list separately. <br />

Scenario where this program comes in handy: <br />
( This is just a scenario, trying not to offend anyone here ) <br />
If you share the same Erikorgu account with your parents and you live alone somewhere else.  <br />
Then you make the menus ready on Erikorgu website <br />
( NB! tick the people who you are gonna dine with,  <br />
the program doesn't calculate the quantity difference between people (yet ;) ) <br />
and download all the menus you need ( I suggest printing them out afterwards to make cooking easier ). <br />
Put the menus in the same directory and follow the 'How it works' guide. <br />

LINK TO DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9o9me859kdhb3uw/ErikOrguShoppingListCreator.jar?dl=1 <br />
Run the program with Java 

How it works: <br />
1. Make your daily menus and download the menus to a specific folder.  <br />
2. Open up the program.  <br />
3. Input/Choose where the folder is positioned.  <br />
4. (Optional) Choose where you want the shopping list to be written, by default it chooses the same directory as the input folder.  <br />
5. Pick out the menus by checking them in the listview.  <br />
6. Click on 'Generate Menu' button  <br />
7. The program generates a text file where all the required components are written in. (Only products with quantity show up.)  <br />
8. Use the data however you want :)  <br />
